# bamazonApp and how it words

This is an application that mimics the basic functions of an online store that gets items from a database, displays it to the user, and allows them to pick items from a list to buy. If the item is lower in quantity than the user supplies, it will cancel the order. Otherwise, the order will go through and the database will update with the new quanitity of items.

## Walkthrough

The app starts when the user enters this command into the console.
